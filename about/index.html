      Hello, I am Oliver Dürr a theoretical / computational physicist by training. I am applying math using computers to all kind of interesting problems since nearly 20 years now. I am especially fascinated in data analysis and statistical learning (a.k.a. machine learning) and what is now called data science. In my research I am currently focusing on <em>deep learning</em>.

      I work as an associate professor / senior lecturer (dozent) for statistical data analysis at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) in Winterthur. My homebase is the institute of data analysis and process design (<a href='http://idp.zhaw.ch/'>IDP</a>). You can find me in my office <a href='https://home.zhaw.ch/~dueo/contact.html'>here</a>.
