title: "Finally I got a website"

Finally, I found some time putting a first website together. It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and one can use markdown to author the posts. I basically followed the instruction given at: [http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

Some things I did not find straight forward.

## Preview the website before commiting to github. 
In the root directory of the project `oduerr.github.io` do:

```
  jekyll serve
```

## Using markdown not only in the posts
If you want to use markdown, simply use the extension `md` instead of the `html` file: the magic happens in the background.
