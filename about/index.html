      Servus, I am Oliver Dürr a theoretical / computational physicist by training. I have been using computers and mathematics for solving all kinds of interesting problems for almost 20 years now. I am especially fascinated about data analysis and statistical learning (a.k.a. machine learning). In my research I am currently focusing on <em>deep learning</em>.
