Our Book on probabilistic deep learning is finally out as an early access version (2 chapters published 5 more to come). In a nutshell, it's deep learning as curve-fitting. 

The first chapters explain "standard" deep learning using the maximum likelihood principle. Later chapters will also include a Bayesian approach to deal with uncertainty. Go and check it out! :-)
