## Deep Learning for HCS

In high content phenotypic screening millions of cells need to be classified based on their morphological appearance. Images of the cells are taken at different 5 'color channels' using different fluorescent markers.

In this project we compared the conventional pipeline (upper branch) against a deep learning approach (lower branch). For the deep learning approach the construction of appropriate feature definitions is part of the training. Compared to the traditional pipeline there is no need for expert knowledge or handcrafted features. The performance is evaluated on an untouched test image set with known phenotype classes. Compared to the best baseline machine learning algorithm, the misclassification rate in the deep learning approach is reduced from 8.9% to 6.6%.
